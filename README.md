# A Dynamic Multilevel Regression and Post-Stratification (MRP) Model in R

The methodological framework for the analysis here is borrowed from Leemann and Wasserfallen (2020). The model is based on one binary dependent variable, four weighting variables (one of those is for geographical units), and one additional variable for a geographical characteristic. Four weighting variables are planned as follows: gender, age, var3 (which is any other variable like education, religiosity, etc.), var_geo. We will benefit those weighting variables as random effects and employ the variable for a geographical characteristic (var_context) to hold for the fixed effect in the MRP model.
```
model <- glmer(dep_var ~ var_context + (1|gender) + (1|age) + (1|var3) + (1|var_geo), 
               data= user_data, family=binomial("probit"))
```

The model will take two datasets (as a user/individual level and an administrational population data) and three parameters (as the number of subcategories of the variables) as inputs and extracts a list that includes prediction for each geographical unit, and a number that shows aggregate average.

It requires following packages in R:
```
install.packages(c("foreign", "lme4", "arm", "extrafont", "readxl", "dplyr"))
```

and takes following datasets and parameters as inputs:
```
user_data <- read_excel("...")
pop_data <- read_excel("...")
N_age <- ...
N_3 <- ...
N_geo <- ...
```

You may find further  technical details in the "Summary" document that mainly describes the structure of datasets, and a brief theoretical explantion in the "Why does one need MRP?" document. We also share sample datasets and an R script to run the MRP analysis for those. We run the sample code in R version 4.1.2.
