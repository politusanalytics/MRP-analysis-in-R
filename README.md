# MRP-intergration

Using the data extracted from online networks for election prediction is often criticized as having a solid demographic bias, referring to a well-known phenomenon that participation in online networks is strongly affected by users' age, sex, education level, race, income level, etc. To deal with this demographic bias, it is suggested to use the multilevel regression and post-stratification method (MRP), which is based on an adjustment of every possible combination of characteristics according to their actual representations in the population. The method has been developed to predict national-level data by non-representative polls or data for smaller areas from representative surveys (called small area estimation).
