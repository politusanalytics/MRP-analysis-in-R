For the sample datasets, we generated random numbers assuming that the total sample size of user data is 500.

Further we considered that the age variable has 3 (from 0 to 2), var3 variable has 4 (from 0 to 3) categories, and we have 7 geographic units.

Therefore, the matrix sizes for the sample_pop_data is 25 x 7, and the sample_user_data is 7 x 501.
