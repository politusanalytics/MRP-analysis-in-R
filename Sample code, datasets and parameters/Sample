For the sample datasets, we generated random numbers assuming that the total sample size of user data is 500. 
Further we considered that 
•	the age variable has 3 (from 0 to 2),
•	var3 variable has 4 (from 0 to 3) categories,
•	and we have 7 geographic units.
In other words:
o	N_age <- 3
o	N_3 <- 4
o	N_geo <- 7
Therefore, the matrix sizes for the sample_pop_data is 25 x 7, and the sample_user_data is 7 x 501.
