For the sample datasets, we generated random numbers assuming that the total sample size of user data is 500.

Further we considered that the age variable has 3 categories (from 0 to 2), var3 variable has 4 categories  (from 0 to 3), and we have 7 geographic units (from 1 to 7).

In other words: 

N_age <- 3

N_3 <- 4

N_geo <- 7

Therefore, the matrix sizes for the sample_pop_data is 25 x 7, and the sample_user_data is 7 x 501.
